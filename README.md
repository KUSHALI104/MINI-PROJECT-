# Project Title

### IMAGE BASED BREED RECOGNITION FOR CATTLE OF INDIA

# 📖 About the Project
This project implements an automated cattle breed classification system using Deep Learning techniques.

A pre-trained ResNet18 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is fine-tuned to classify cattle images into different breeds.

The system performs end-to-end processing, including dataset preparation, model training, evaluation, visualization, and deployment through a Flask-based web application.

This project is developed as an Academic Mini Project.

# 📊 Results and Impact

The cattle breed classification model based on ResNet18 achieved good accuracy and stable performance.
Training and validation loss curves showed proper convergence, while accuracy graphs indicated minimal overfitting.
The confusion matrix and evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score) confirmed reliable classification across all cattle breeds.

This project demonstrates the effective use of deep learning in agriculture, enabling automated cattle breed identification.
It reduces manual effort, supports farmers and veterinarians in decision-making, and serves as a practical educational project in AI and Computer Vision.
The system is scalable and can be extended to additional breeds or deployed on web and mobile platforms.
